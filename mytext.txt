Trust constitutes a fundamental basis of human society and plays a pivotal role in almost every aspect of human relationships Although enormous interest exists in determining the neuropsychological underpinnings of a person's propensity to trust utilizing task based fMRI however little progress has been made in predicting its variations by task free fMRI based on whole brain resting state functional connectivity RSFC Here we combined a one shot trust game with a connectome based predictive modeling approach to predict propensity to trust from whole brain RSFC We demonstrated that individual variations in the propensity to trust were primarily predicted by RSFC rooted in the functional integration of distributed key nodes caudate amygdala lateral prefrontal cortex temporal parietal junction and the temporal pole which are part of domain general large scale networks essential for the motivational affective and cognitive aspects of trust We showed further that the identified brain behavior associations were only evident for trust but not altruistic preferences and that propensity to trust and its underlying neural underpinnings were modulated according to the extent to which a person emphasizes general social preferences ie horizontal collectivism rather than general risk preferences ie trait impulsiveness In conclusion the employed data driven approach enables to predict propensity to trust from RSFC and highlights its potential use as an objective neuromarker of trust impairment in mental disorders
BACKGROUND Leukoaraiosis is characterized by white matter lesions WMLs on magnetic resonance imaging MRI and is associated with cognitive impairment The small world network is viewed as the optimal brain network with maximal efficiency in information processing Patients with cognitive impairment are thought to have disrupted small world networks In this study we compared the small world network attributes between controls study participants without memory complaints and patients with WMLs with cognitive impairment MATERIAL AND METHODS All study participants were prescreened using MRI and neuropsychological tests Patients with WMLs were further divided into 2 groups according to the result of Montreal Cognitive Assessment MoCA ie WMLs with non dementia vascular cognitive impairment WMLs VCIND and WMLs with vascular dementia WMLs VaD Resting state functional MRI data were collected and applied with graph theoretical analysis to compare small world properties between the 3 groups RESULTS We found that the overall functional connectivity strength was lowest in the WMLs VaD patients but highest in the normal control study participants Patients in both the WMLs VCIND and the WMLs VaD groups had decreased small world properties compared with the group of normal control study participants Moreover the small world properties significantly correlated with MoCA scores CONCLUSIONS These findings suggest potential constructive reorganization of brain networks secondary to WMLs and provides novel insights into the role of small world properties in cognitive dysfunction in WMLs
For severely paralyzed people Brain Computer Interfaces BCIs can potentially replace lost motor output and provide a brain based control signal for augmentative and alternative communication devices or neuroprosthetics Many BCIs focus on neuronal signals acquired from the hand area of the sensorimotor cortex employing changes in the patterns of neuronal firing or spectral power associated with one or more types of hand movement Hand and finger movement can be described by two groups of movement features namely kinematics spatial and motion aspects and kinetics muscles and forces Despite extensive primate and human research it is not fully understood how these features are represented in the SMC and how they lead to the appropriate movement Yet the available information may provide insight into which features are most suitable for BCI control To that purpose the current paper provides an in depth review on the movement features encoded in the SMC Even though there is no consensus on how exactly the SMC generates movement we conclude that some parameters are well represented in the SMC and can be accurately used for BCI control with discrete as well as continuous feedback However the vast evidence also suggests that movement should be interpreted as a combination of multiple parameters rather than isolated ones pleading for further exploration of sensorimotor control models for accurate BCI control This article is protected by copyright All rights reserved
